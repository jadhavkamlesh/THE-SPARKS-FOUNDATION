Prediction-of-Student-Marks_through-Regression


Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn In this notebook we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions.
We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

I will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score, based upon the number of hours they studied.

Data ca be found at htp://bit.ly/w-data
At the end after building our model we will test that what will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hours in a day?
